For this article you should focus on the findings reported for Experiment 1 in section 3.2 Results. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures (NB. for Table 1 you need only consider the rows that refer to Exp 1):

> The second two rows of Table 1 shows the averages across non-optimizers for each type of face. As shown in the table, for the type b faces, a positive interference effect occurred (see the last column, labeled Int). However, for the type g faces, there was only a very small positive interference effect. It is also interesting that there was no difference in the categorization results for C-D trials as compared to C-only trials, p(G)≈p′(G).

> A statistical test was performed, separately for each type of face, using the interference effect obtained from each participant as the dependent variable. The statistical tests were computed using all 169 participants. The mean interference effect for the type b faces was statistically significant from zero (t(168)=2.24,SE=.015,p=.027), but it was not significant for the g faces (t(168)=.61,SE=.013,p=.54).

> There were strong correlations between p(G) and p′(G) (r=.52,p<.0001 for type b faces, r=.65,p<.0001 for type g   faces). The correlations between p(A) and pT(A) were not as strong (r=.46,p<.0001 for type b faces, r=.51,p<.0001 for type g faces). There was a very small negative correlation between the interference effects produced by the two different types of faces (r=-.16,p=.04). In addition, p(A|B) differed between the two types of faces.
